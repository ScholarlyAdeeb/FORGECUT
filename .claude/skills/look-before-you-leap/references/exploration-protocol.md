# Exploration Protocol

Answer ALL 8 questions before writing a plan. If a question doesn't apply,
write "N/A" — do not skip it. You are NOT ready to plan until all 8 have
concrete answers and your confidence is Medium or higher.

Exploration feeds the plan artifacts directly: `plan.json` (immutable
definition), `progress.json` (mutable execution state), and `masterPlan.md`
(user-facing review document). Use the current workspace path convention
`.temp/plan-mode/active/<plan-name>/` when referring to those files.

## Step 0a: Codex preflight (ALWAYS run first)

Run `command -v codex` to determine Codex availability BEFORE any
exploration. This is not optional — do NOT assume availability.

- If available → co-exploration is mandatory (see conductor Phase 1)
- If unavailable → explore solo, document under `## Codex Availability`
  in discovery.md, use `codexStatus=unavailable` for the discovery receipt

## Step 0b: Run deps-query (when configured)

If dep maps are configured, run `deps-query.py` on every file in scope
BEFORE answering the questions below. The output reveals consumers,
cross-module dependencies, and blast radius — shaping all subsequent
exploration. A hook enforces deps-query usage; this step ensures you run
it proactively rather than being blocked later.

Record all output — you'll need it for Q3, Q7, and discovery.md. If dep
maps are NOT configured and this is a TypeScript project, suggest
`/generate-deps` to the user.

## 1. What is the scope?

Which files and directories will this change touch?

**How to answer**: `Glob` for likely file patterns. Read the user's request
word by word — identify every noun that maps to a file or module.

**Output**: List of file paths with boundaries ("ONLY these files, NOT those").

## 2. What are the entry points?

Which files will you directly modify?

**How to answer**: Read each candidate file. Note its current state, key
functions, exports, and line count.

**Output**: File path + brief description of contents for each entry point.

## 3. Who are the consumers?

Who imports or uses the files you're changing?

**How to answer (dep maps configured)**: Run `deps-query.py` for each entry
point file. Record the DEPENDENTS output. A hook enforces this — grepping
for import patterns will be blocked when dep maps exist.

**How to answer (no dep maps)**: `Grep` for import/require statements
referencing each entry point file. Example: `Grep pattern="from ['\"].*auth" type="ts"`

**Output**: List of consumer files with count. If >10, list count + examples.
When dep maps are configured, include the exact deps-query output for each
file queried.

## 4. What patterns already exist?

How does this codebase solve similar problems?

**How to answer**: Read 2-3 sibling files in the same directory. Check for
shared utilities via `Grep`. Read CLAUDE.md, README.md for conventions.

**Output**: Naming patterns, error handling approach, data flow conventions.

## 5. What test infrastructure exists?

Where do tests live? What framework? Any test utilities?

**How to answer**: `Glob` for `**/*.test.*`, `**/*.spec.*`, `**/test/**`,
`**/__tests__/**`. Read one test file to identify the framework and patterns.
Check package.json for test scripts.

**Output**: Framework name, test file location pattern, how to run tests.

## 6. What are the project conventions?

Style, structure, tooling preferences?

**How to answer**: Read CLAUDE.md (if exists), check for .eslintrc, tsconfig,
prettier config. Note import ordering, naming style, file organization.

**Output**: Key conventions that constrain implementation choices.

## 7. What is the blast radius?

What could break if you get this wrong?

**How to answer (dep maps configured)**: Use `deps-query.py` — its
DEPENDENTS count is the blast radius. The hook enforces this over grep.

**How to answer (no dep maps)**: For each entry point, count its consumers
(from Q3). For shared types/utilities, grep for all usages. Identify any
public API surfaces.

**Output**: List of risk areas with consumer counts.

## 8. What is your confidence?

Can you write a complete plan right now?

**How to answer**: Review questions 1-7. Any gaps? Any "I assume..." statements
that should be verified?

**Output**: Low / Medium / High with justification.

- **Low**: Stop. Explore more before planning.
- **Medium**: Proceed but flag unknowns in the plan.
- **High**: Proceed with full confidence.

### Planning note

The plan is only ready once the exploration answers support the exact files,
review flow, and any strict receipt expectations that will appear in the
plan. If the task needs strict completion gating, note that in discovery so
the plan can document it explicitly.
