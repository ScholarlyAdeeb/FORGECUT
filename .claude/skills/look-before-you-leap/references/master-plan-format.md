# masterPlan.md Template

masterPlan.md is the **user-facing proposal document** reviewed via Orbit.
It communicates intent, critical decisions, warnings, and risk — NOT
execution state. Execution state lives in `progress.json` (see
`references/plan-schema.md`).

**Write-once**: `masterPlan.md` is frozen after Orbit approval. It is never
updated during execution. `plan.json` is also immutable after approval.
All runtime state (progress, results, deviations, codex sessions) lives in
`progress.json`, updated via `plan_utils.py`. This keeps both the proposal
and the plan definition as stable records of what was agreed upon.

If a plan is intended to run in strict receipt mode, say so in the context or
risk notes so the reviewer knows that completed steps will be gated on the
required verification receipts.

No `[x]`/`[ ]` checkboxes. No progress tracking. No result fields.
Just what, why, and what could go wrong.

# Plan: <Descriptive Title>

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SKILL: Use look-before-you-leap:engineering-discipline
> for all steps. Also invoke each step's `Skill` field when it is not `none`.
> See the Required Skills section for the full list.

## Context

<2-3 sentences: what the user asked for, what project this is, key constraints.
Write this so a fresh context window understands the task without needing the
original conversation.>

## Required Skills

<List any installed skills that should be invoked at specific steps. Use exact
skill identifiers. Format:

- **Step N**: `look-before-you-leap:frontend-design` (full mode)
- **Step M**: `look-before-you-leap:writing-plans` (plan generation)

If no external skills are needed, write "None — all work covered by core
disciplines.">

## Applicable Disciplines

<Which discipline checklists apply to this task. Format:

- **testing-checklist.md** — applies at Steps N, M (writing/modifying tests)
- **security-checklist.md** — applies at Step K (auth/input handling)
- **git-checklist.md** — applies at all commit points>

## Discovery Summary

<Structured findings from exploration. Complete ALL 8 sections.>

### Scope
<What files/directories are in scope. Be explicit about boundaries.>

### Entry Points
<The primary files to modify.>

### Consumers
<Who imports/uses the files you're changing.>

### Existing Patterns
<How similar problems are already solved in this codebase.>

### Test Infrastructure
<Testing framework, test location, how to run tests.>

### Conventions
<Project-specific conventions.>

### Blast Radius
<What could break. Consumer counts, shared types, public API surfaces.>

### Confidence Rating
<Low / Medium / High with justification.>

## Steps

### Step 1: <Title>
- **Owner**: codex | claude  (codex is the conductor-mode default; claude requires Claude-only skill OR RN Routing Directive OR documented routing-matrix override)
- **Mode**: codex-impl | claude-impl | dual-pass  (exactly three valid values; mixed-ownership work is split into sequential single-owner steps with `dependsOn`)
- **Routing**: <category from routing matrix> → <owner>-<mode> [reason if override]
- **Skill**: `look-before-you-leap:refactoring` | none
- **Simplify**: true/false
- **QA**: true/false
- **Codex verify**: true (always — no exceptions)
- **DependsOn**: `[]` or list of step IDs that must complete first
- **Files involved**: `src/foo.ts`, `src/bar.ts`
- **Description**: What needs to happen in this step.
- **Acceptance criteria**: How to know this step is done.

### Step 2: <Title>
...

## Blocked Items

<List anything that's blocked, why, and what's needed to unblock.
If nothing is blocked, write "None.">

## Risk Areas

<Highlight areas where things could go wrong — consumer breakage, security
implications, performance concerns, areas requiring manual verification.
If no notable risks, write "None.">
```

## Naming Convention

Plan directories use kebab-case under `.temp/plan-mode/active/`:

- `.temp/plan-mode/active/migrate-auth-to-v2/` (good)
- `.temp/plan-mode/active/fix-login-bug/` (good)
- `.temp/plan-mode/active/task-1/` (bad — not descriptive)

When all steps are complete, the plan folder moves to `completed/`.

## Small Task Plans

Even small tasks get plans, but masterPlan.md can be minimal:

```markdown
# Plan: Fix Login Button Alignment

## Context
The login button on /auth/login is misaligned on mobile viewports.

## Required Skills
None — all work covered by core disciplines.

## Applicable Disciplines
- **ui-consistency-checklist.md** — applies at Step 1

## Discovery Summary

### Scope
Only `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`.

### Entry Points
- `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` — login page with misaligned button wrapper

### Consumers
N/A — not changing any shared components.

### Existing Patterns
Other auth pages use `w-full` on mobile button wrappers.

### Test Infrastructure
N/A — visual change only.

### Conventions
Tailwind breakpoint is `md` (768px) per tailwind config.

### Blast Radius
None — single file, no shared code.

### Confidence Rating
High — issue is clear, fix is straightforward.

## Steps

### Step 1: Fix button alignment
- **Owner**: claude
- **Mode**: claude-impl
- **Routing**: Frontend UI / visual design → claude-impl (skill in Claude-only list: frontend-design)
- **Skill**: `look-before-you-leap:frontend-design`
- **Simplify**: false
- **QA**: false
- **Codex verify**: true
- **DependsOn**: `[]`
- **Files involved**: `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`
- **Description**: Add `w-full` to the button wrapper div for mobile viewports
- **Acceptance criteria**: Button is full-width on mobile, unchanged on desktop

## Blocked Items
None.

## Risk Areas
None.
```

## Relationship to plan.json and progress.json

masterPlan.md, plan.json, and progress.json are written during the planning
phase (see `writing-plans` skill). They contain the same steps, but:

| Aspect | plan.json | progress.json | masterPlan.md |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Audience** | Claude + hooks | Claude + hooks | User (via Orbit) |
| **Content** | Step definitions, criteria, files, ownership | Status, results, progress items, deviations | Intent, decisions, risks |
| **Execution state** | No (immutable after approval) | Yes (all mutable state) | No |
| **Updated during execution** | Never (frozen) | Yes (via plan_utils.py) | Never (frozen) |
| **Reviewed via Orbit** | No | No | Yes |
| **Parsed by hooks** | Yes (structure) | Yes (state) | Legacy fallback only |

The schemas are documented in `references/plan-schema.md`.
